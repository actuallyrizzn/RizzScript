# RizzScript Documentation

Welcome to **RizzScript: Voice Studio** — a desktop application that turns raw audio into fully diarised, speaker-attributed transcripts.

This `docs/` directory contains comprehensive, task-oriented guides for every type of audience:

| Guide | When you should read it |
|-------|-------------------------|
| `installation.md` | You are setting up RizzScript on a new machine. |
| `user_guide.md` | You want to learn how to use the GUI and its features. |
| `architecture.md` | You need a high-level understanding of how the code is organised and how data flows. |
| `api_reference.md` | You are extending RizzScript and need to know class/function signatures. |
| `developer_guide.md` | You plan on contributing code, reporting bugs, or cutting a new release. |

All files are written in pure Markdown, so you can view them on GitHub, your favourite editor, or any static site generator.

> Looking for a quick start? Head straight to [`installation.md`](installation.md) and then [`user_guide.md`](user_guide.md).
